# Citing St. Jude Cloud

We are currently in progress of preparing the St. Jude Cloud manuscript. Until further notice, please ensure that when St. Jude Cloud or data accessed therein is used in your work, please:

1. Cite the relevant paper for each of the datasets and/or resources that you used in your study.

2. State in the **Results** and/or **Methods** section that the relevant data and/or resource was obtained from St. Jude Cloud. Example statement:
>"Whole genome sequencing data for relapse tumor samples from 345 pediatric patients were obtained from St. Jude Cloud."
           
3. State in the **Data availability** section of the manuscript that data and/or resource can be accessed via St. Jude Cloud. Example statement:
>"Whole genome sequencing data for pediatric relapse tumor samples used for analysis in this study were obtained from St. Jude Cloud (https://www.stjude.cloud) â€“ a publicly accessible pediatric genomic data resource requiring approval for controlled data access."
