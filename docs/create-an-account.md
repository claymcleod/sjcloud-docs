# Create an account

In order to request St. Jude data and work with that data in the cloud, you will need to create a DNAnexus account and use it to log in to St. Jude Cloud. St. Jude Cloud is built on top of the [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/) genomics cloud ecosystem. For a comprehensive overview of how DNAnexus works, see 
[this page](https://www.dnanexus.com/product-overview). Each new user whether regular or internal will receive a $50 credit upon creation of their DNAnexus account.

!!! note
    The login process is slightly different based on whether you are an internal user (you work at St. Jude) or an external user. Please view the appropriate section below for more details on each.

## Regular user

### Account creation

If you work at an institution that is not St. Jude (the standard case), you can use the following process to create an account:

1. Go to the [DNAnexus log in page](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login).
2. Click "Create an Account".
3. Fill in your information.
4. On the Create New Account page, make sure to select "Microsoft Azure (westus)" as the Default Cloud Region.
5. Click 'CREATE ACCOUNT'

### Logging in

Simply go to the [DNAnexus log in page](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login), enter the username and password that you registered with from the preceding section, and click 'LOG IN'.

### Lab billing setup
1. Click on the drop down next to your user name in the far right of the DNAnexus navigation bar, and select 'Profile'.
2. Click on 'Billing Account' from the tabs listed just under the navigation bar.
3. Click on the green 'ADD BILLING INFO' button to the right of your account name.

4. A window labeled 'ACCOUNT UPGRADE' will pop up. In this window agree to DNAnexus's Terms of Service, agree to DNAnexus's pricing model, review your account information, and finally enter your billing information.
5. Click 'Upgrade Account'. This will send an email to the individual listed as the billing contact requesting that they verify the change.

## Internal user

### Account creation

If you are a St. Jude user, you can log in using the following process:

1. Navigate to the internal DNAnexus login page [here](https://cloud.stjude.org).
2. Enter your St. Jude credentials. 
3. You should automatically be signed into DNAnexus and redirected. If this is your first time visiting this page, a DNAnexus account will be automatically created for you using your St. Jude email address and password. 

### Logging in

Internal users log in to St. Jude Cloud through the [internal DNAnexus login page](https://cloud.stjude.org). Simply enter your St. Jude credentials and click 'Submit'. This will redirect you to your Projects page on DNAnexus.

!!! note
    If you are unable to log in at this link, it probably means you have already set up a DNAnexus account through the [DNANexus log in page](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login) using your St. Jude email address. In this case, a DNAnexus account is already linked to your St. Jude email. To continue using this account, you will need to log in through the [DNAnexus log in page](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login).

### Lab billing setup

If you are the first St. Jude Cloud user in your lab, you will need to set up a 'billing org', a DNAnexus group of users (such as a single lab) whose compute costs are billed to the same place. We offer a step-by-step guide to walk internal users through this process.

Please go to the [intranet home page](https://home.stjude.org) and type 'Bioinformatics Self-Service' into the search bar. From there, click on the link that says 'Bioinformatics Self-Service on St. Jude Cloud' to access the internal guide to setting up a billing org.

If a DNAnexus billing org already exists for your lab, you can contact your lab's Cloud Administrator about adding you to your lab's org.
