# Create an account

St. Jude Cloud is built on top of the [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/) genomics cloud ecosystem. For a comprehensive overview of how DNAnexus works, see 
[this page](https://www.dnanexus.com/product-overview). In order to request St. Jude data and work with that data in the cloud, you will need to create a DNAnexus account and then log in to St. Jude Cloud using it.

!!! note
    The login process is slightly different based on whether you are an internal user (you work at St. Jude) or an external user. Please view the appropriate section below for more details on each.

## Regular user

### Account creation

If you work at an institution that is not St. Jude (the standard case), you can use the following process to create an account:

    Madison, is this the right way to go? If so, could we fill these in with screenshots? I feel like users like the steps laid out verbatim, and I feel like we need to make it as easy as possible since signups are a key metric for us.

1. Create an account by going to the [DNANexus log in page](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login).
2. Clicking "Create an Account".
3. Fill in the information.
4. On the Create New Account page, make sure to select "Microsoft Azure (westus)" as the Default Cloud Region.

### Logging in

    I do think it would be good to tip the hat to the login problems internal users sometimes face and give them a step-by-step guide to logging in. This will also help us with support requests, as we can just link them to this section

## Internal user

### Account creation

If you are a St. Jude user, you can log in using the following process:

1. Navigate to the internal DNAnexus login page ([here](cloud.stjude.org)).
2. Enter your St. Jude credentials. 
3. You should automatically be signed into DNAnexus and redirected. If this is your first time visiting this page, a DNAnexus account for you using your St. Jude email address and password.

    Same idea, should we enumerate the steps with screenshots?

### Lab billing setup

    Historically, we have avoided putting an intranet link on the internet. There may be a better way to do this, but this was the best I had at the time.
