can find this by looking at the tags for each file or in the `SAMPLE_INFO.txt`
file that is included with each data request. To learn more, please visit the dedicated section in our [guide](./guides/genomics-platform/requesting-data/about-our-data.md#standard-metadata).
* Any data in St. Jude Cloud Visualization Community or St. Jude Cloud PeCan is considered published.
