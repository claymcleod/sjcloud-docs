# Welcome to St. Jude Cloud Documentation!

## Overview

Here, you'll find
authoritative guides for accessing St. Jude Cloud data, running analysis workflows (our workflows or your own) on the cloud,
and exploring curated data from numerous published studies by St. Jude and our collaborating institutions. For a brief overview of
everything St. Jude Cloud provides, we recommend that you watch the video
on [our home page](https://stjude.cloud).

Sign up [here](https://hospital.stjude.org/apps/forms/fb/st-jude-cloud-subscribe/) to receive email notifications when we add new datasets, analysis pipelines, or other exciting features.

## Features

You can apply many different capabilities of St. Jude Cloud to your research, such as:

* Explore the [raw genomics data](https://platform.stjude.cloud/requests/diseases) we currently offer. You can browse by diagnosis, publication, or curated dataset while applying a number of different filters. For more information, see our [data request guide](./guides/genomics-platform/requesting-data/data-request.md).
* Run your tools on *our* data by [requesting data](./guides/genomics-platform/requesting-data/data-request.md) and packaging your tools in a secure cloud environment. See this [guide](./guides/genomics-platform/analyzing-data/creating-a-cloud-app.md) for an example.
* Run our in house analysis workflows on *your* data by [moving your data](./guides/genomics-platform/managing-data/data-transfer-app.md) to the cloud and selecting a [workflow](#analysis-workflows) to run. See this [guide](./guides/genomics-platform/analyzing-data/running-sj-workflows.md) for an example. 
* Explore St. Jude datasets through interactive visualizations that we have packaged for the community. For example, visit [PeCan](https://pecan.stjude.cloud) to visually investigate pediatric cancer mutation data.
* Create manuscript quality figures with *your* data to use in publications or to host on your website with [ProteinPaint](https://pecan.stjude.cloud/proteinpaint/TP53) or [GenomePaint](https://genomepaint.stjude.cloud/). See the [ProteinPaint](./guides/visualization-community/protein-paint.md) and [GenomePaint](./guides/visualization-community/genome-paint.md) doc pages for help.

!!! note
    Please note that while it is free to receive and store our data in St. Jude Cloud, there are [compute and storage fees associated with working in the cloud, as well as egress fees for downloading our data](faq.md#will-i-be-charged-for-using-st-jude-cloud).

## Portals

St. Jude Cloud provides a number of user portals which you can use to interactively explore the results we produce. Click on the links below to
visit each of the corresponding portals.

* [Pediatric Cancer Portal (PeCan)](https://pecan.stjude.cloud). Interactively explore mutational recurrence and pathogenicity assessment of variants in pediatric cancer using a wide variety of St. Jude + publicly available data.
* [Sickle Cell Diseases Portal](https://sickle-cell.stjude.cloud). Explore the latest from the Sickle Cell Genomics Project (a collaboration between St. Jude and Baylor College of Medicine).
