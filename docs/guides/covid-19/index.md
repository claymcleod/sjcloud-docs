### Overview

* The sudden, fully remote operation of St. Jude research staff due to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused higher than normal demand on VPN and HPC cluster resources. 
* Since the announcement of remote work, the St. Jude Cloud team has working with Information Services to create a plan to rapidly on-board interested labs to the cloud, relinquishing you of VPN and cluster issues while allowing you to continue your work. 
* This page serves as a guide for how you can quickly try out the cloud and what experimental offerings we have been prototyping to ease your transition.
* To read about the different levels of engagement we are offering during this time, please continue reading below. If you're just interested in getting started, you can jump to the [walkthrough section](#walkthrough).

!!! tip 
    Currently, this is guide is focused on omics-based data analysis. The DNAnexus ecosystem can be used for many other types of data analysis, and can serve as a secure cloud environment to easily do other types of research. If you are interested, please [contact us](mailto:support@stjude.cloud) and let us know â€” we'd be happy to help.
