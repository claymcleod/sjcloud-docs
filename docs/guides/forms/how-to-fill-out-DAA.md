#Filling Out The DAA

Please read carefully through the first 5 pages of the [Data Access Agreement (DAA)](../../guides/glossary/data-access-agreement) which consist of Terms and Conditions that you and your institution must agree to in order to access any data on St. Jude Cloud.

Next, ensure that you have correctly filled out the 5 required sections of the DAA (Note that there are [2 additional required sections](#data-download-permission) if you intend to download data):

1. **Page 5** [The Data Access Unit(s)](../../guides/glossary/data-access-unit) you are applying for must be marked.
    * Tip: The DAU(s) associated to the data you requested are listed in the section Controlled Access Data, above the Download Data Request
      Form button. This can be found on the third step of the data request
      process. This is a dynamic feature
      that allows the user to see exactly which Data Access Units (datasets)
      they are requesting data from.

2. **Page 6** Signature and information of the Principal Investigator. 
    * This must be signed by a Principal Investigator or a faculty-level supervisor on the project.

3. **Page 7** Signature and information of all other applicants. 
    * This should include any person(s) who will have access to this data. They are legally bound to protecting and handling the data properly.

4. **Page 8** Signature and information of Institutional or Administrative Authority. 
    * This individual cannot be the same Principal Investigator that signed above, as this section is to provide a second-party authority of the instituion to ensure that the institution will uphold the terms of this agreement.

5. **Page 10** Description of contemplated use of St. Jude data. 
    * Here, describe your research question and it's biological significance. The Contemplated Use will be evaluated by the [Data Access Committee(s)](../../guides/glossary/data-access-committee) based on their own set of protocols. 
    * Please [contact us](https://stjude.cloud/contact) if you have any questions regarding the protocols of the approval process. 

### Data Download Permission

Additionally, *if and only if* you would like to *download* the data,
you will also need to include the following:

### Uploading A Revised DAA

If your DAA is incomplete (for example you missed a required signature or neglected to check the box next to a dataset for which you requested data), you will be contacted by a member of the St. Jude Cloud team. Once you have made the required edits, you can reupload a revised DAA through the [Manage Data page](https://platform.stjude.cloud/requests/manage) by clicking on the *Add a Form* button.
