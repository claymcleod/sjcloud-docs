#Filling Out The DAA

To download the latest version of the [Data Access Agreement (DAA)](../../glossary.md#data-access-agreement) click [here](../../files/DAA_v4_10-1-2019.pdf). Please read the first 6 pages carefully, which consist of terms and conditions that you and your institution must agree to in order to access any data on St. Jude Cloud.

### Required Sections

Next, ensure that you have correctly filled out the 5 required sections of the DAA (Note that there are [2 additional required sections](#data-download-permission) if you intend to download data):

1. **Page 7** [The Data Access Unit(s)](../../glossary.md#data-access-unit) you are applying for must be marked.
    * Tip: The DAU(s) associated to the data you requested are listed in the section Controlled Access Data, above the Download Data Request
      Form button. This can be found on the third step of the data request
      process. This is a dynamic feature
      that allows the user to see exactly which Data Access Units (datasets)
      they are requesting data from.

2. **Page 8** Description of contemplated use of St. Jude data.
    * Here, describe your research question and it's biological significance. The Contemplated Use will be evaluated by the [Data Access Committee(s)](../../glossary.md#data-access-committee) based on their own set of protocols.
    * Please [contact us](https://stjude.cloud/contact) if you have any questions regarding the protocols of the approval process.

3. **Page 9** Signature and information of the Principal Investigator.
    * A Principal Investigator (PI) is designated by the grantee organization to direct the project or activity being supported by the grant. The PI is responsible and accountable to the grantee for the proper conduct of the project or activity. The role of the PI within the eRA Commons is to complete the grant process, either by completing the required forms via the eRA Commons or by delegating this responsibility to another individual. A PI can access information for any grant for which they are designated the PI. See eRA Commons Roles & Privileges Matrix. Typically the PI signee is the faculty-level supervisor on the project, but it is not a requirement.

4. **Page 10 & 11** Signature and information of all other applicants.
    * This should include any person(s) who will have access to this data. They are legally bound to protecting and handling the data properly.

5. **Page 12** Signature and information of Institutional or Administrative Authority.
    * This individual cannot be the same Principal Investigator that signed above, as this section is to provide a second-party authority of the institution to ensure that the institution will uphold the terms of this agreement.

### Uploading A Revised DAA

If your DAA is incomplete (for example you missed a required signature or neglected to check the box next to a dataset for which you requested data), you will be contacted by a member of the St. Jude Cloud team. Once you have made the required edits, you can reupload a revised DAA through the [Manage Data page](https://platform.stjude.cloud/requests/manage) by clicking on the *Add a Form* button.
