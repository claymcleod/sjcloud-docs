#Filling Out The DAA

For the latest version of the [Data Access Agreement (DAA)](../../glossary.md#data-access-agreement) click
[here](https://platform.stjude.cloud/access_form). Please read carefully through the first 5 pages of the which consist of Terms and Conditions that you and your institution must agree to in order to access any data on St. Jude Cloud.

Next, ensure that you have correctly filled out the 5 required sections of the DAA (Note that there are [2 additional required sections](#data-download-permission) if you intend to download data):

1. **Page 5** [The Data Access Unit(s)](../../glossary.md#data-access-unit) you are applying for must be marked.
    * Tip: The DAU(s) associated to the data you requested are listed in the section Controlled Access Data, above the Download Data Request
      Form button. This can be found on the third step of the data request
      process. This is a dynamic feature
      that allows the user to see exactly which Data Access Units (datasets)
      they are requesting data from.
