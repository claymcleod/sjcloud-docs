#Data Access Units

## What is a Data Access Unit (DAU)?
A Data Access Unit is a grouping of data that typically corresponds to a dataset generated at the same time at the same institution, and can also correspond to a specific study. Each DAU has its own Data Access Committee, which contains the researchers who reside over the data. Each Data Access Committee has its own protocols for approving access to their DAU. If you have questions about committee approval protocols, please Contact Us. Basic clinical data is available for relevant subjects in each DAU. We currently have 3 DAUs. 

### Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP)
**PCGP is a paired-tumor normal dataset focused on discovering the genetic origins of pediatric cancer.**
The Pediatric Cancer Genome Project is a collaboration between St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine that sequenced the genomes of over 600 pediatric cancer patients. 

### St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE)
**SJLIFE is a germline-only dataset focused on studying the long-term adverse outcomes associated with cancer and cancer-related therapy.**
St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) is a longevity study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital that aims to identify all inherited genome sequence and structural variants influencing the development of childhood cancer and occurrence of long-term adverse outcomes associated with cancer and cancer-related therapy. This cohort contains unpaired germline samples and does not contain tumor samples. 

### Clinical Genomics (Clinical Pilot and G4K)
**Clinical Genomics is a paired tumor-normal dataset focused on identifying variants that influence the development and behavior of childhood tumors.**
Clinical Genomics is a cohort from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, comprised of two studies: Clinical Pilot and Genomes4Kids. Clinical Pilot is a smaller, pilot study generated to asses the validity and accuracy of moving forward with the G4K study. These studies aim to identify all inherited and tumor-acquired (somatic) genome sequence and structural variants influencing the development and behavior of childhood tumors.
