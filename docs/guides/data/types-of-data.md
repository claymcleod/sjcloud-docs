St. Jude Cloud hosts both raw genomic data files and processed results files:

| File Type   | Short Description                                                                            | Details                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| BAM         | HG38 aligned BAM files produced by [Microsoft Genomics Service][msgen]                       | [Click here](#bam-files)         |

#### BAM files

In St. Jude Cloud, we stored aligned sequence reads in the ubiquitous BAM file format. BAM files were produced by the [Microsoft Genomics Service][msgen] aligned to HG38 (GRCh38 no alt analysis set). For more information about how Microsoft Genomics produces BAM files or any other questions regarding data generation, please refer to [the official Microsoft Genomics whitepaper][msgen-whitepaper].

For more information on SAM/BAM files, please refer to the [SAM/BAM specification][bam-spec]. 

#### gVCF files

We provide gVCF files produced by the [Microsoft Genomics Service][msgen]. gVCF files are derived from the BAM files produced above as called by [GATK's haplotype caller][gatk-haplotype-caller]. Today, we defer to [the official specification document][gvcf-spec] from the Broad Institute, as well as [this discussion][gvcf-diff-from-vcf] on the difference between VCF and gVCF files. For more information about how Microsoft Genomics produces gVCF files or any other questions regarding data generation, please refer to [the official Microsoft Genomics whitepaper][msgen-whitepaper].

#### Somatic VCF files

Somatic VCF files contain HG38 based SNV/Indel variant calls from the St. Jude somatic variant analysis pipeline as follows. Broadly speaking:

1. Reads were aligned to HG19 using [bwa backtrack][bwa] (`bwa aln` + `bwa sampe`) using default parameters.
2. Post processing of aligned reads was performed using [Picard][picard] `CleanSam` and `MarkDuplicates`.
3. Variants were called using the [Bambino][bambino-paper] variant caller (you can download by navigating [here][bambino-program] and searching for "Bambino package").
4. Variants were post-processed using a in-house post-processing pipeline that cleans and annotates variants. This pipeline is not currently publicly available.
5. Variants were manually reviewed by analysts and published with [the relevant Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP) paper][pcgp-landing-page].
6. Post-publication, variants were lifted over to HG38 (the original HG19 coordinates are stored in the `HG19` INFO field.).

For more information on variants for each of the individuals, please refer to the relevant PCGP paper. For more information on the variant calling format (VCF), please see the latest specification for VCF document listed [here][hts-specs].
