A St. Jude Cloud **Data Access Committee (DAC)** is group of St. Jude researchers who oversee access to a particular [Data Access Unit (DAU)](../../guides/glossary/data-access-unit) and evaluate incoming data requests.

The first time you request access to files in 
a DAU, it is required that you fill out a [Data Access Agreement (DAA)](../../guides/glossary/data-access-agreement). Access is granted at the DAU level
based on the decision of each DAC upon reviewing the DAA.

!!! example
    For example, if you make a request asking for all of St. Jude's Acute 
    Lymphoblastic Leukemia sequencing data, you might be asking for data from 
    multiple different projects (DAUs) here at St. Jude. For the sake of the example,
    let's say the data you want is spread across three different DAUs. Once
    you place a request, your application will be routed to the corresponding
    three data access committees for approval. Since each DAC is made up of
    different individuals using different criteria for evaluation, you may or
    may not be approved for access to all of the files.
