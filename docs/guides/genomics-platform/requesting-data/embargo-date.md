The **Embargo Date** specifies the date that a publishing embargo on the file in question has been lifted. Publishing using any of the files _before_ the embargo date has passed is strictly prohibited as outlined in the [Data Access Agreement (DAA)](../../guides/glossary/data-access-agreement). Typically, samples from the same [Data Access Unit (DAU)](../../guides/glossary/data-access-unit) all have the same embargo date, as they would have been released on St.
Jude Cloud at the same time.
