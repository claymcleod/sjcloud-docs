# St. Jude Cloud Genomics Platform

Genomics Platform is an app that allows you to browse, request, host, and analyze raw next-generation sequencing data. This app is a collaboration between [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), and [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/). 

We provide high quality next generation Whole Genome (WGS), Whole Exome (WES), and RNA-Seq data to researchers around the world. There is a [request process](./requesting-data/data-request.md) to protect this data even though it is de-identified. One of the benefits of partnering with DNAnexus is that users can not only access our data, but also upload their own.
