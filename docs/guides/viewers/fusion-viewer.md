# ProteinPaint Fusion Viewer

The ProteinPaint interactive fusion viewer is used to visualize putative
fusions called by CICERO. You can follow these steps to get an
understand of how it works.

    this file will vary, so consult the specific pipeline guide to know
    where to find it.

    viewer.

3.  Once the page has finished loading, you will be presented with a
    summary of all of the fusions produced by the pipeline. Each bullet
    point is a separate category for the structural variants, with the
    more interesting fusions at the top. Click one of the categories to
    view the fusions in that category.
