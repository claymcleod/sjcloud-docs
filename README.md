### üè† [Homepage](https://stjude.cloud/docs)

## Install

First, note that we include the theme as a submodule. You must use the
`--recurse-submodules` command when you clone the repo to get everything needed
to build the docs.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:stjudecloud/docs.git
```

We use conda to achieve consistency amongst our environment setups. You must [install conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) before running the commands below.

```bash
conda env create
conda activate docs
```

If you wish to install the dependencies in your own Python environment without conda, you can certainly do so, but you're on your own :).

## Usage

You can use the following commands to get started working with the docs.

```bash
# Build the docs once
mkdocs build

# Run a development server
mkdocs serve
```

## Deployment

Commits to `master` automatically deploy after 5-10 minutes to https://stjude.cloud/docs. There is no other deploy process available (or needed) currently. If you are working on a large change, we highly recommend you start a branch and submit a pull request when you are finished.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome!<br />Feel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/stjudecloud/docs/issues). You can also take a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/stjudecloud/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
