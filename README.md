### üè† [Homepage](https://stjude.cloud/docs)

## Install

First, note that we include the theme as a submodule. You must use the
`--recurse-submodules` command when you clone the repo to get everything needed
to build the docs.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:stjudecloud/docs.git
```

We use conda to achieve consistency amongst our environment setups. You must [install conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) before running the commands below.

```bash
conda env create
conda activate docs
```

If you wish to install the dependencies in your own Python environment without conda, you can certainly do so, but you're on your own :).

## Usage

You can use the following commands to get started working with the docs.

```bash
# Build the docs once
mkdocs build

# Run a development server
mkdocs serve
```

## Development

St. Jude Cloud's documentation is built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). All features outlined in the mkdocs-material technical documentation should be available to be enabled and used. 

Please follow these best practices:

* Heavily research and understand what mkdocs-material supports! Particularly [admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/) and [code highlighting](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/codehilite/). These will greatly improve the quality of your documentation.
* You are permitted to use HTML tags and elements when Markdown does not support something you need (e.g. underlining), but please use Markdown when at all possible. The code base will become very hard to maintain if we use HTML unnecessarily.
* When working on large features, please make a branch and submit a pull request.
* We will continue to add automation to ensure links are live, words are spelled correctly, etc. Please pay attention to these statuses as you check-in code.

## Deployment

Commits to `master` automatically deploy after 5-10 minutes to https://stjude.cloud/docs. There is no other deploy process available (or needed) currently. If you are working on a large change, we highly recommend you start a branch and submit a pull request when you are finished.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome!<br />Feel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/stjudecloud/docs/issues). You can also take a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/stjudecloud/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
