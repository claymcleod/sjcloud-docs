Pipeline Operation
==================

.. caution::
   This pipeline assumes HG19 coordinates. If you BAM file is
   not HG19, you'll need to realign or provide FastQ input files. 

.. _rapid-rnaseq-upload:

Uploading Data
--------------

The Rapid RNA-Seq analysis pipeline takes paired, Gzipped FastQ files generated from
RNA-Seq data as input. You can upload the files you would like to run using the
:ref:`desktop-application` or by uploading data manually using the :ref:`commandline`.

.. note:: You should click "Start" before attempting to upload data
          to the tool (the tool's workspace is only created once you do this). After you
          are redirected, you can safely close the tab that was just opened.

Input File Configuration
------------------------

Click "Start" on the `tool's landing page <https://platform.stjude.cloud/tools/rapid_rna-seq>`_.
You will redirected to the tool's workspace, with the workflow automatically pulled 
up.

.. note:: If you do not see a screen similar to the one below, click the "Rapid RNA-Seq" item in
          the project.

The inputs to the pipeline are on the left side of the screen (see the red rectangle
in the image below) and all of the outputs are on the right side of the screen. You'll
need to connect the files you uploaded in :ref:`rapid-rnaseq-upload` to their respective
input file slots. The orange color denotes required inputs that you have to complete
before the pipeline can run. The green "Run as Analysis" button in the top right will
remain disabled until all inputs are correctly specified.

#. Click the :code:`Fastq/R1` input file slot in orange.

#. Select the "read 1" Gzipped FastQ file from your workspace.

#. Click the :code:`Fastq/R2` input file slot in orange.

Parameter Configuration
-----------------------

There are no parameters to configure for the Rapid RNA-Seq pipeline.

Running the Pipeline
--------------------

You should now see a screen similar to the one below. Note 
that the green "Run as Analysis" button in the top-right is 
no longer disabled. You can click the button to start the analysis.
