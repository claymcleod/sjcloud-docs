Data Access Agreement
========================

Broadly speaking, the Data Access Agreement (DAA) is a legal document binding the requestor 
and the requestor's institution to terms about how our data may be used. We do not negotiate
the terms of this document unless terms are found to be in conflict with state law. 
Filling out the Data Access Agreement carefully and completely is crucial to having your
request filled promptly.

Why Do I Need to Sign A DAA?
-------------------------------
Although the DAA serves many purposes, the terms included in the agreement are ultimately 
in place to protect our patients. We take patient security very seriously, and we require that 
requestors are committed to protecting that privacy to the fullest extent.

Where Can I Find A Blank DAA? 
-------------------------------
You can find this document on the last step of :ref:`request-data`, or you can 
download a copy `here <https://platform.stjude.cloud/access_form>`_.

Filling Out The DAA
------------

A few things to remember:

   - We please ask that you submit the DAA as pdf, as this is the easiest format for us to process and may lead to a quicker turn-around for your request.
   - A "Title" refers to your official given job title. 
   - A job title must indicate that the person signing fulfills the role of the position for which they are signing. 
   - The following section is for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to fill out if, and only if, the requestor is approved for data access by the Committee.

Where Do I Submit This Document? 
-------------------------------
On St. Jude Cloud, we require that the requestor makes a formal data request on the site. This ensures 
the safety of the data, as it makes sure the data is vended to the correct account. Please see the last step of 
our documentation :ref:`request-data` to see where you can submit this form during the formal request process.

What Happens After I Submit My DAA?
------------------
After you submit your complete Data Access Agreement, your request will be sent to the corresponding Data 
Access Committee(s). There are currently 3 Data Access Committees (DACs), one to reside over each of the 
3 datasets (Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, St. Jude LIFE, and Clinical Genomics/G4K).
