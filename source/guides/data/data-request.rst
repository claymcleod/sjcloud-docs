========================

Submitting a data request is necessary when you would like access to a Data Access Unit to 
which you do not already have access.

2. Next, select the cohort you are interested in requesting. You can browse our data by different cohorts: disease, publication, dataset, or you can use 
PeCan, our Pediatric Cancer portal to find samples associated with specific genes, or mutations. 

*Note: If you are looking for PCGP data, please select by “Datasets”.*

3. Once you have selected the cohort you would like to study, you can chose what type of files you would 
like to receive. This step is dynamic, and shows you all of the file types we have available for the 
dataset you are interested in.

4. Please enter all required information. If you are requesting access to a dataset you have not already 
been approved for, you will see a section called Controlled Data. Under this section, there is a bulleted 
list that indicates the Data Access Units you are requesting access to. Please use this list to fill 
in the Datasets section of the Data Request Form. Click the Download Data Request Form button under 
the list of Data Access Units to download the St. Jude Cloud Data Access Agreement.
